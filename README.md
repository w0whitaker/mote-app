# Mote UI

Mote UI is a library of native Web Components. It is divided into two "layers": composition and utility. Composition elements are used to create layouts, while utility elements are used to provide functionality.

## Acknowledgements
A lot of the inspiration for this project comes from Andy Bell and Heydon Pickering's [Every Layout](https://every-layout.dev/). I am deeply indebted to both of them. 
## Composition
Generic composition elements provide the layout structure, not just of whole pages, but of utility elements as well.
